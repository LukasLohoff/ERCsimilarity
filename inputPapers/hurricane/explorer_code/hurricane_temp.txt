            the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO), are quantiﬁed using a Bayesian
            hierarchical model ﬁt to the averaged data. As expected, stronger hurricanes tend to have higher intensiﬁcation
            rates, especially over the warmest waters. Of the three climate variables considered, the NAO has the largest
            effect on intensiﬁcation rates after controlling for intensity and SST. The model shows an average increase in in-

            in the NAO index. Weak trade winds associated with the negative phase of the NAO might result in less vertical
            windshear and thus higher mean intensiﬁcation rates.
